#### Demonstrate application and removal of classes via jQuery

#### By Jeremy Banka and Brandon Magofna

## Technologies Used

* HTML5
* CSS3
* ES6
* jQuery 3.6.0

## Description

This is a single-page jQuery demo that shows how jQuery .on method can be used to set the background color for your whole page.

We achieve this result by setting a class on the <body> whose styles are defined in our cssâ€”but not before _removing_ all classes from the <body>. This way, our classes won't have conflicts with each other.

## Setup/Installation Requirements

* _This is a great place_
* _to list setup instructions_
* _in a simple_
* _easy-to-understand_
* _format_

_{Leave nothing to chance! You want it to be easy for potential users, employers and collaborators to run your app. Do I need to run a server? How should I set up my databases? Is there other code this application depends on? We recommend deleting the project from your desktop, re-cloning the project from GitHub, and writing down all the steps necessary to get the project working again.}_

## Known Bugs

* _Any known issues_
* _should go here_
